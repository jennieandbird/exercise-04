```{r Step_1}
# Create your own custom function called load_dictionary() that takes a single argument, “filename”, that can be used to read in either of the two data files you downloaded.

library(tidyverse)
library(curl)
library(dplyr)

# use a public repo because it liked the links to end in .txt instead of the token
w11 <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennieandbird/exercise-04/main/collins-scrabble-words-2019.txt") 
w22 <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennieandbird/exercise-04/main/google-10000-english-usa-no-swears.txt")
w33 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennieandbird/exercise-04/main/google-10000-english-usa-no-swears.txt"
w32 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennieandbird/exercise-04/main/collins-scrabble-words-2019.txt"

load_dictionary <- function(filename) {
  v1 <- read_csv(filename)}

# Once you have created your function, use that function to create two variables, solution_list and valid_list, that, respectively contain vectors of possible solution words and valid words to guess. That is, you should be able to run the following to create these two vectors

valid_list <- load_dictionary(w33)
solution_list <- load_dictionary(w32)

w1 <- read_csv(w11)
  df <- w1 |>
  filter(nchar(words) == 5)

w2 <- read_csv(w22)
  df <- w2 |>
  filter(nchar(words) == 5)


joined_words <- inner_join(w1, w2, by = c("words"))
